This is the detailed explanation of the FeedProject
1.To get the RSS Feed from CNN, I have used an API (RSS2JSON -https://rss2json.com/) 
2. The data sent by the above API is in json, so to deserialize the json, I have generated a model class with the JSONdata
called (RSSContentdata.cs).
3. Ajax is used to get the data from the API and sending the data to the webservice for parsing (RSScontent.cs).
4. The webservice is used to deserialize the json and generate a datatable.
5. The datatable is inserted in the db using the Dbconfig class methods.
6. All the Database methods are inside a single class which is inside a folder called dao.
7. Once the feeds are saved in the DB, the user can then click on the display feed button to show the current feeds for today.
For this project - I have only used the feeds for the specific day the user will be using the application.
8. The feeds are displayed inside a simple <div> containers and the links are not activated to avoid opening multiple tabs 
in the browser which can be a bit of nuisance for testing user interactions with a post and updating the most viewed posts.
9. A timer is run in the background which runs after every specific time intervals and the timer_tick calls the gridupdate()
which shows the feeds that have been most viewed followed by the others in descending order.
10. The application is real time and the gridview is updated with the feeds by most user interactions.

Current constraints-
1. The html view can be improved significantly.
2. Websockets can be implemented to make it more real time.
3. The architecture can be improved significantly.
4. Currently, the feed can be save for a day only once in the db. So, no matter how many times a user clicks on the getfeedfortoday button, it will not hamper with the db because a stored procedure handles the appropriate logic.
